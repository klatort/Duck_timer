# Some features
## You can put any song you like inside the sound/music folder and it will be randomly selected, also the ducks move at the speed of the song's BPM (sort of since it is using a library to aproximate it)
## You can also implement your own ducks with the divide_gif.py file since it strips any .gif file into a framesheet, it uses an input and an optional output argument.
'''
python divide_gif.py -i duck.gif
# This will output duck-frames.png file in the same directory
'''

# TODO
- Make user time input more user friendly.
- Delete gif files and clean sprites.
- Change the time up sounds
